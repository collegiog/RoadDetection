# RoadDetection
Detection of roads in urban areas using geometric and radiometric data from an Airborne LASER Scanning System.

This research project proposes to detect roads from ground points of Airborne LASER Scanning (ALS) using geometric and radiometric attributes. ALS data allows describing terrain
surface in detail, whether natural or man-made targets. For an analysis of the roads, the point cloud generated by ALS, initially, is treated by a pre-processing, whose progressive filtering method must classify the points into two subsets: terrain points (roads) and points of elevated objects. Once the points are classified into two subsets, Digital Radiometric Intensity Models (DRIMs) are generated to identify the roads in regions obstructed by vegetation and apply the thresholding method to detect them. Optical data are commonly used, but through ALS, there is a difference in the treatment with geometric and radiometric data, which mitigates the problem of occlusion resulting from the presence of vegetation on the roads. The results obtained showed that the method adequately detects roads in this context, however, postprocessing based on digital image processing is required to fill certain regions of the scene arising from vegetation and/or buildings.
