# RoadDetection
Detection of highways in urban areas using geometric and radiometric data from an Airborne LASER Scanning System.

In this research project, the analysis of terrain points from a Laser Scanning System (SVLA) is proposed, to detect points belonging to the roadbed, based on geometric and radiometric data of this system. The data generated by an SVLA allow an effective mapping of the swept surface, considering both natural and anthropogenic targets. The development refers to the automatic methodology for detecting the road network in an urban area, and it is only up to the operator to analyze and interpret the extracted information. Therefore, the properties of the SVLA data come from radiometry, derived from optical physics, which concerns the measurement of electromagnetic radiation, as well as the geometric aspect of the terrain, associated with the characteristic of geographic features (curves, straight lines, points, polygons, etc.) in three-dimensional space. To detect roads in an urban area, the progressive filtering method is adopted, which acts to separate points of interest (highway) and non-interest points to generate a Digital Radiometric Intensity Model (MDIR), mitigating the potential of the roads detected in MDIRs aided by digital image processing algorithms.
